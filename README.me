# 💸 Money Muling Detection System

### Graph-Based Suspicious Transaction Detection using FastAPI & Network Analysis

The **Money Muling Detection System** is a backend-driven analytical platform designed to identify suspicious financial transaction behavior that may indicate **money muling activity**.

The system analyzes transaction records uploaded as CSV files and uses graph-based modeling, statistical analysis, and risk scoring techniques to detect potentially fraudulent accounts.

---

## 📌 Features

* CSV transaction upload (single or multiple files)
* FastAPI backend detection engine
* Transaction graph construction
* Risk scoring using statistical features
* Suspicious account identification
* JSON result generation

---

## ❓ What is Money Muling?

Money muling is a financial crime in which an individual transfers illegally obtained money between accounts to hide the original source of funds.

Criminal networks typically use multiple intermediary accounts (called **mules**) to:

* Break traceability
* Launder stolen money
* Move funds rapidly across accounts

Traditional rule-based fraud detection fails here because criminals use **relationships between accounts**.
Therefore, this project applies **graph/network analysis**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Process large transaction datasets automatically
* Convert financial transactions into a graph network
* Detect abnormal fund flow
* Score accounts by suspicious behavior
* Identify mule chains and intermediary accounts
* Provide API-based detection results

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a **3-Layer Architecture**.

### 1️⃣ Frontend (Vue.js)

* Upload CSV file
* Upload folder containing CSV files
* Trigger detection
* View results

### 2️⃣ Backend (FastAPI)

* File handling
* CSV validation
* Data preprocessing
* Graph building
* Risk computation

### 3️⃣ Detection Engine

* Feature extraction
* Pattern detection
* Suspicious scoring

## 📤 API Endpoint

### POST `/detect`

Accepts:

* Single CSV file
* Multiple CSV files

Returns:

* Suspicious accounts
* Risk scores
* Transaction summary

---

## 📄 Expected CSV Format

| sender | receiver | amount | timestamp           |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| A101   | B302     | 15000  | 2024-01-01 12:30:00 |

**Field Description**

* `sender` → account sending money
* `receiver` → account receiving money
* `amount` → transaction amount
* `timestamp` → transaction date & time

---

## 🔍 Detection Methodology

### 1. Data Validation

* Verify CSV structure
* Remove invalid records

### 2. Data Cleaning

* Handle missing values
* Convert timestamps
* Normalize data types

### 3. Time Window Analysis

Transactions are grouped into rolling windows to detect rapid transfers.

### 4. Graph Construction

Each account becomes a **node** and each transaction becomes a **directed edge**.

```
Node  = Account
Edge  = Transaction
Weight = Amount
```

### 5. Feature Engineering

For each account:

* Incoming transaction count
* Outgoing transaction count
* Total inflow
* Total outflow
* Flow ratio
* Transaction frequency

### 6. Risk Scoring

Risk score is calculated using a sigmoid transformation:

```
Risk Score = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
```

Higher score ⇒ Higher suspicion.

## 🚨 Suspicious Patterns Detected

### Circular Transfer

```
A → B → C → A
```

### Layering Chain

```
A → B → C → D → E
```

### Hub Account

```
      B
      ↑
A →   X   → C
      ↓
      D
```

## 📊 Output

The API returns JSON containing:

* Suspicious accounts
* Risk scores
* Transaction statistics

---

## 📈 Scalability

Designed to handle:

* 10,000–50,000+ transactions
* Modular processing pipeline
* Extendable detection engine

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
